Highlights in a sports video are the key exciting moments in the match which attract attention of the spectators in the match. A considerable amount effort is spent in extracting such highlights from the match requiring a lot of investment in terms of time and cost where the domain experts decide which frames must be included in the highlight, thus making it an expensive process, so there should be ways of generating automated highlights. We use audience reactions to classify frames in the game as ”highlights” and ”standard play”, because this method can be generalized to detect highlights in any sport. For this purpose, we have used the S-HOCK dataset which contains videos of spectators watching an ice-hockey match. In order to do so, we experiment
with different methods to generate automatic highlights, using
3D Convolutional networks, HOG-SVM and pre-trained
models on similar sports datasets. We obtained an accuracy of 26% using HOG-SVM,
67% using pre-trained models and 74% using 3D-CNN.
